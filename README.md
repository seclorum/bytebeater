An experimental playground for byebeat synthesis techniques.

This was inspired by the THX Sound generator (thxsnd.c) I found somewhere, I forget where.

Added a supersaw generator that uses a similar bytebeat technique.

Might add other techniques when I feel inspired.

Use the "test" targets (See Makefile) to test the output.  

Uses sox for compatibility on MacOS, but could also be piped into aplay if you are on Linux and don't want to use sox.
